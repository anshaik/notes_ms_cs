--Overview

Structured vs unstructured

set vs list
	set: no duplicates
	list: could be duplicated

Relational DB is structured data
	Oracle, DB2, IBM, etc 

Unstructured could be a news article

semi-structured data: i.e. XML, HTML

Facebook, i.e. has billions of users, each has unique profile. 
	video/images are unstructured, complex data
	FB contains all types of data (structured, semi, un)

Data is huge 

consider banking application - data is updated frequently (withdraw/deposit of amounts)

model: write-once, read many (FB status, Twitter tweets)

Google idea: Google File System

	MapReduce
	Stored on Hadoop or GFS
	storage kept in commodity hardware 
		may die/go down, therefore replication. duplication factor is 3

Grading
	Two exams (open book) - 45%
		March 23rd
		May (not comprehensive)

	4 assignments and a group project

--Lecture 01/ Big Data Intro

Big data is...
	3 Vs: Volume, Velocity, Variety
	Scale (Volume) - data is increasing exponentially 
	Complexity (Variety) - data can come in various formats
		static vs streaming
	Speed (velocity) - data is being generated fast and needs to be processed
		late decisions = missed opportunities
		i.e. promotions are too late / recomendations aren't valid any more
	Added V: Veracity
		data in doubr: uncertainity due to inconsistency / incompleteness

Harnessing Big Data
	OLAP quries. lots of grouping (Data Warehousing solution)

	Example:
	select sum(profit)
	from walmart_profit
	where city='plano'

		What's the problem of this approach? works in a batch oriented manner. decisions can't be made in real-time. this model may not be effective. 

	RTAP: real-time analytics processing

Who are generating big data?
	social media, scientific instruments, mobile devices
	no longer hindered bu ability collect
	but, ability to analyze this data in timely manner is the requirement of big data management and analytics
